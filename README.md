## Summary
All companies, from minor to big ones, needed to control their warehouse. Many entrepreneurs in Brazil commonly use inefficient methods that spend a lot of time, for example, spreadsheets, because large WMS systems are too expensive. Through this project, our goal was to create a WMS free and accessible for everyone, where any business can create an account and control their warehouse without risks and with shelf life and minimum quantity alerts.
